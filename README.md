“Baby Quiz” (https://baby-quiz-ac640d.webflow.io) is an interactive website designed and developed by me for the Controversial Design course at Chiba University.

The task of the Controversial Design course is to find a controversial social issue, and express it with interactive design. Although it’s not a mandatory requirement, the ideal outcome would be to complete the visual design as a fully accessible website.

In this project, I chose the topic of reproductive issues, establishing a clean yet impactful visual design. I reviewed numerous papers and reports to present data from reliable sources and created engaging user interaction by allowing website visitors to participate in a questionnaire and receive responses. Not only did I implement the webpage through Webflow, but I also built a backend for recording and processing questionnaire data on Airtable facilitating further data analysis.
